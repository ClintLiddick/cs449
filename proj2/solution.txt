found by x/s examining global address 0x80b316c assigned to %esi, and used in a string compare
"repz cmpsb" with the user inputted line

cwl12_2 solution:
cwl12

found by following the <s>/<r> functions (strlen), <c> function that replaces newline with \0,
and user input string alterations: replacing \0 with "_2", appending a new '\0', and strcmp
with an internal string (still not sure where esi was assigned, unless <r> didn't return strlen)
