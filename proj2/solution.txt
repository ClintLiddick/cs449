cwl12_1 solution:
EhkyRldrbhUuaSlphYTJXdRjJV

Found by x/s examining global address 0x80b316c assigned to %esi, and used in
a string compare "repz cmpsb" with the user inputted line

cwl12_2 solution:
cwl12

Found by following the <s>/<r> functions (strlen), <c> function that 
replaces newline with \0, and user input string alterations: replacing \0 
with "_2", appending a new '\0', and strcmp with an internal string (still 
not sure where esi was assigned, unless <r> didn't return strlen)

cwl12_3 solution:
!!!!!!!!!!
Or any combination of 10 of the following:
[!#$%&()*@^]

Two counters in the program serve to divide the 10 input chars into 2 groups,
one group satisfies the equation (asciival - 33) = [0,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,31,61]
and increments the second counter, any other value increments the first
counter (either by indexing to a jump to increments it, or if (val-33) > 61).
The index is multiplied by 4 to access full word (4 byte) boundaries.

Any input that causes the second counter to equal 10 unlocks the program.
